## Configuration file for CAVA. Default values are commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting.

[general]
mode = normal # smoothing mode, can be normal, scientific or waves.
framerate = 60 # Default: 60. Accepts only non-negative values.
sensitivity = 7 #  is sensitivity %. Accepts only non-negative values.
bars = 0 # the number of bars. 0 sets it to auto (fil upp console). 
bar_width = 3 # width of bars. 
bar_spacing = 1 # space between bars.
lower_cutoff_freq = 50 # the lower cutof frequency for the far left bar
higher_cutoff_freq = 10000 # the higher cutoff frequency for the far right bar. Note: there is a minimum total bandwith of 43Mhz x number of bars. Cava will automaticly increase the higher cuttoff if a too low band is specified.


[input]
method = pulse # supported input methods are 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
source = alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor # ALSA device or FIFO path.

[output]
method = ncurses # method used to draw output may be ncurses, noncurses or circle.
style = mono # visual styles, may be 'stereo' or 'mono'. Stereo mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center. Mono avrages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies

[color]
# supported colors are: red, green, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, blue, black.
; background = black
foreground = blue

[smoothing]
integral = 0.7 # multiplier for the integral smoothing calculations. Takes values from 0 - 0.99. Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
monstercat = 0 # disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing". Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable. 
gravity = 1 # Set gravity multiplier for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster. Accepts only non-negative values. 0.5 means half gravity, 2 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
ignore = 0 # set bars with height lower than this to 0

[eq]
# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want. More keys = more precision. Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
1 = 1 # bass
2 = 1
3 = 1
4 = 1
5 = 1 # treble
