my dots
=======

mostly stolen

my current setup
----------------

* __zsh__ as shell
* __herbstluftwm__ as wm
* __vim__ as editor
* __ncmpcpp/mpd__ as music player/server
* __weechat__ as irc client (i use it for steam though)
* __dunst__ as notification daemon
* __sxhkd__ as hotkey daemon

my todo
-------

- [ ] try crux
- [x] try wmutils (not for me, no real tiling)
- [x] try mksh (no brace expansion :( )
- [x] try st (i see no reason for switching, also it messes up my fonts smh)
- [x] make my own colorscheme instead of stealing it from somewhere
